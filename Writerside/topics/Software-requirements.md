# Software Requirements

To run FVG Vision AI, the system is designed to operate in a **Docker container**, which provides a consistent and
isolated
runtime environment. This containerized setup simplifies installation, configuration, and updates, making it easier to
deploy on compatible hardware.

**Docker**: Docker is required to deploy and run FVG Vision AI. You can install Docker by following the instructions on
the
official Docker website. Docker enables smooth cross-platform compatibility, allowing the application to run identically
across different environments.

**Operating System**: While Docker provides platform flexibility, FVG Vision AI has been specifically tested and
optimized
on Linux systems with Ubuntu 22.04. Although it may run on other **Linux distributions**, **Ubuntu 22.04** offers the
highest
compatibility and is recommended for stability and performance.
