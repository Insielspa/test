# System Requirements

Running FVG Vision AI on your systems requires specific hardware and software configurations to ensure optimal
performance and compatibility. Due to the intensive nature of computer vision tasks, the application relies on
particular hardware capabilities, especially for real-time processing and inference tasks, as well as software
dependencies that enable a stable and consistent runtime environment.

Meeting these requirements will help the application run smoothly and efficiently, whether you are deploying on an
NVIDIA Jetson platform, a CUDA-capable PC, or a non-GPU-supported machine.
