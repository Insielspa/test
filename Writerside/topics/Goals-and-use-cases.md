# Main goals

The primary objectives of **FVG Vision AI** are to deliver a flexible, scalable, and high-performance solution for
real-time video analysis in a variety of scenarios. The system is designed with the following key goals in mind:

1. **Real-Time Object Detection and Tracking**  
   FVG Vision AI leverages advanced computer vision algorithms through Ultralytics and OpenCV to detect and track
   objects in real time. The system can be customized to identify specific object categories, enabling applications such
   as crowd management, security monitoring, and traffic analysis.

2. **Modular and Scalable Architecture**  
   The application follows a modular design, separating the functionality into distinct modules for input, processing,
   notifications, and output. This structure allows for easy customization and scalability, ensuring that the system can
   be adapted to different environments, from local edge devices (like Jetson ORIN AGX) to more powerful cloud or
   server-based setups with NVIDIA GPUs.

3. **Cross-Platform Compatibility**  
   With Docker-based deployment, FVG Vision AI can run on a range of hardware, from standard NVIDIA-powered PCs to
   Jetson edge devices. This versatility allows for seamless integration in diverse operational settings, making it
   suitable for both on-site installations and cloud-based solutions.

4. **Flexible Configuration**  
   FVG Vision AI offers a highly configurable system where users can adjust the application's behavior through default
   configuration files, environment variables, or command-line parameters. This flexibility makes it easy to fine-tune
   performance based on the hardware in use, operational scenarios, and output requirements.

5. **Multiple Video Output Formats**  
   The system supports multiple output formats, including HTTP Live Streaming (HLS) and JPEG snapshots, which are served
   via a built-in Nginx server. This provides users with a choice of video formats suitable for both continuous video
   streaming and lightweight image-based monitoring.

6. **Scenario-Based Use Cases**  
   FVG Vision AI is designed to handle specific real-world scenarios such as:
    - Counting people in a defined area.
    - Monitoring parking lot occupancy.
    - Detecting raised hands (e.g., for security or event monitoring).
    - Counting line crossings (useful for monitoring entry and exit points).

7. **Event-Based Notification System**  
   To support real-time decision-making, FVG Vision AI can integrate with Azure IoT Hub to send notifications based on
   specific events or thresholds detected in the video stream. This enables users to act quickly based on the data
   collected from video analysis.

8. **Performance Benchmarking**  
   The system includes a benchmark mode to test and measure performance in various scenarios. This allows users to
   monitor FPS, resource utilization, and overall system efficiency, helping to optimize the configuration for specific
   hardware and operational needs.

9. **High-Performance Edge Computing**  
   Optimized for both powerful server environments and lightweight edge devices like the Jetson ORIN AGX, FVG Vision AI
   delivers high-performance analytics directly at the edge, reducing latency and the need for cloud processing.
